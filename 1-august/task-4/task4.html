 The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser. 
 This window object has the majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.
 The document object is your html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc. What does this really mean? That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property, 
 if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.
 The screen object, implementing the Screen interface, is a special object for inspecting properties of the screen on which the current window is being rendered. 
 There are many properies available on this object that can be used to determine and set some properies of the client's screen.
